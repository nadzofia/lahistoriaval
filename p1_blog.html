                      <h2>Geography</h2>
                      <p>Valenzuela is located at 14°40′58″N 120°58′1″E.
                        <br><br>Valenzuela, officially the City of Valenzuela known as the Northern Gateway to Metropolitan Manila is located in the largest group of islands of the Philippines, Luzon in the National Capital Region, about 14 kilometers (8.7 mi) north of Manila, the country’s capital. With the land area of 47.02 square kilometers or 18.15 square miles the city is bordered by the town of Obando and the city of Meycauayan in Bulacan,the city of Navotas in the west, Malabon in the south, and Quezon City and northern portion of Caloocan in the east that are areas located near and inside Metro Manila, making it its 12th city and 83rd in the Philippines back in the Ramos Regime in 1998. According to the City profile of the Valenzuela,  the city has 33 barangays including Pulo, Punturin, Viente Reales, Malinta etc. inhabited by 714,978 people that was determined by the 2020 Census was representing 5.30% of the total population of the National Capital Region. Moreover, about 16.3 kilometers  (10.1mi) west of the city, located the country’s top port for trade and industry known as Port of Manila(Pantalan ng Maynila).  The highest point is located 125 feet (38 meters) above sea level. Situated in Canumay's industrial area, the mountainous environment has a surface gradient of 0.55% and a moderate slope. There are 2 meters (6.6 feet) of elevation gain on average above sea level.
                        <br><br>The 15-kilometer (9.3mi) Tullahan River or Teneheros-Tullahan River separates Valenzuela and Malabon. Tullahan is a part of the Marilao-Meycauayan-Obando river system of central Luzon.It is currently regarded as biologically dead and one of the dirtiest river systems in the world. The riverbanks of Tullahan were formerly lined with mangrove trees and abundant in freshwater fish and crabs. The name of the river comes from tulya, or clam, due to the abundance of such shellfish in the area. Before the river was contaminated by growing enterprises nearby, children used to play in it. Due to inadequate drainage and inappropriate solid waste management, periods of heavy rainfall and high tides have been brought about by increased climate variability linked to global warming. This has resulted in stagnant water that may remain in the region for up to four weeks. In addition to being vulnerable to water-borne illnesses like dengue and leptospirosis, people are frequently left stuck within their houses. In order to control the danger associated with rising rainfall, better early warning systems are required.</p>

                            <h2>The People as a Community</h2>
                            <p><strong><em>Administrative division and Local Government</em></strong>
                                <br><br>Valenzuela is composed of 33 barangays, the smallest administrative unit in the city. This means that there 33 barangay captains or punong barangay heading their own barangay and has 231 -manned local council or mga kagawad in total that are duly elected by the residents. Youth sector of the barangay is represented by the youth council called the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) headed by the SK chairperson and his 7-manned assembly, also known as mga SK kagawad. The barangays also serve as the census area of the city. Moreover, Valenzuela is split into two congressional districts at the federal level: the first legislative district, which includes 24 barangays in the city's northern half, and the second legislative district, which includes the remaining 9 barangays in the city's southern section. Legislative districts, in contrast to barangays, are represented by congressional members in the Philippine House of members but without a political leader.
                                <br><br>Like other cities in the Philippines, Valenzuela is governed by a mayor and a vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. As the executive leader of the city, the mayor oversees the departments responsible for carrying out municipal laws and providing public services. The elected Mayor of Valenzuela in the Year 2024 is Weslie T. Gachalian. While, the vice mayor is in charge of a 14-member legislative council, which is made up of six councilors from each of the city's two districts and two ex officio positions held by the presidents of the Sangguniang Kabataan Federation and the Association of Barangay Chairman, who represent the barangay and youth sectors, respectively. The council is responsible for drafting resolutions and ordinances that establish the policies for the city.</p>

                      <h2>Arrival of the Earlier Population</h2>
                      <p><em><strong>Settlers in colonization and Philippine Revolution </strong></em>
                       <br><br>Before the arrival of Spanish colonizers, the area that is now Valenzuela was inhabited by indigenous communities engaged in agriculture and fishing. These early settlers lived in harmony with the natural environment, relying on the fertile lands and abundant waterways for their livelihood. The indigenous population had established a structured community, complete with social hierarchies and local governance.
                       <br><br>During the Spanish occupation in the Country, the area of Valenzuela and neighboring areas including Obando and Quezon City was part of Bulacan.  The area was called Polo, which was made up of a few little political villages as well as four haciendas: Malinta, Tala, Piedad, and Maysilo. Between 1756-1763 in the European conflict called The Seven Years war, the Philippines was invaded by the British East India. The locals at that time moved to forests and mountains to escape the British forces that explored the communities of Malanday, Wakas, Dalandanan, Pasolo, Rincon and Mlainta, resulting in many deaths of the population from malaria. The British then proceeded to Malolos, Bulacan where they were ambushed by the stationed Spanish Soldiers. These allowed the residents of Polo to return and rebuild their homes. This period of turmoil was commemorated with the feast of St. Roch (San Roque) on May 12.
                       <br><br>In the mid-19th century, the establishment of the Hacienda Tala as a penal colony and the construction of a new road connecting Polo to Novaliches facilitated further development. These infrastructure improvements contributed to the growth of the local economy and the integration of various communities within Polo.
                       <br><br>Polo was subjected to the cruel Japanese occupation during World War II. The village became a hub for spies and collaborators with the Makapili, which resulted in widespread crimes and terror. Over a hundred guys from Polo and Obando were killed in a Japanese massacre on December 10, 1944. The old San Diego de Alcalá church was destroyed following the town's massive devastation sustained during the liberation by joint Filipino and American forces.
                       <br><br>On November 7, 1975, Valenzuela was incorporated into Metro Manila, marking a significant shift in its administrative and economic landscape. This incorporation integrated Valenzuela into the rapidly developing capital region, facilitating access to larger markets and more resources. Major infrastructure developments, such as the opening of the North Luzon Expressway in 1968, spurred further growth and industrialization. The once predominantly agricultural town transformed into an industrial hub, attracting businesses and factories.

                      <h2>Foundation</h2>
                      <p>The foundation of Valenzuela as an independent town is marked by its separation from the town of Catangalan (now Meycauayan) in Bulacan. Spanish Governor-General Alonso Fajardo de Entenza issued a decree on November 12, 1623, to build the town of Polo, which would subsequently become Valenzuela. Don Juan Monsód, a local leader, and Franciscan friar Juan Taranco worked to meet the community's administrative and spiritual requirements, which ultimately led to the separation. A church was constructed in St. Didacus of Alcalá's honor, and the town was named after him. After Spanish and Japanese occupation in the country in 1960, President Carlos P. Garcia ordered the split of Polo's southern barangays to form another town named Valenzuela. The split was revoked by President Diosdado Macapagal in 1963 after political disagreements and the newly merged town was named Valenzuela.
                        <br><br>The name Valenzuela, which is a diminutive of Valencia and means “little Valencia” pays tribute to Dr. Pio Valenzuela, a significant participant in the Philippines Revolution. The name Polo, which dates back to before 1960, was derived from the word “pulo”, which means “island”, because the region’s rivers give it an island-like aspect. With the Tullahan River to the south and streams originating from the Rio Grande de Pampanga surrounding it, the area’s topography is reflected in its name
