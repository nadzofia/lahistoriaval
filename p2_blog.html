                      <h2>Valenzuela's Key Historical Events</h2>
                      <p>Valenzuela City's historical timeline is linked with the surrounding conflicts, transformative events, and crucial social movements that have deeply influenced its development across time. Spanning from the Philippine-American War's Battle of Malinta to the founding of Polo as an independent municipality, followed by its administrative division and reunion, the city's history is evident in cycles of resilience and adaptivity to historical adversities.</p>

                      <h2>Battles</h2>
                      <p><em>Battle of Malinta (March 26, 1899)</em>
                        <br><br> In the past, Malinta was a huge estate which stretched to as far as parts of Novaliches, which also used to be part of the old Polo, which is what is known in the present as Valenzuela City.  The American forces must pass through Malinta before they could advance to the town proper of Polo where the Filipino military troops’ command center was led by its Director de Guerra, Gen. Antonio Luna. It was, therefore, necessary to seize it first.  But the Filipino revolutionary forces, which, in all likelihood, may have included some Valenzuelanos, did not yield so easily. These Filipino revolutionaries fiercely defended Malinta. While American sources might say they took Malinta, local historian Jerry Gracio argues the Filipinos weren't defeated. Filipino historical accounts and American archives confirm a battle on March 25th, 1899. Filipino forces used marked poles to gauge the American advance and opened fire when they were close enough. This tactic, described as "accurate" in some American documents, inflicted heavy casualties on the Americans, including Colonel Harry Clay Egbert, the leader of the US 22nd Infantry. This event was regarded as a less important moment in Philippine history, however its significance in the past of Valenzuela City is irrevocable, further symbolized with the unveiling of a historical marker turned over from the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP).

                            <p><strong><em>Founding of Polo (November 7, 1621)</em></strong>
                                <br><br>Needing a church of its own, Polo became a separate town. Back in 1595, Manila became a big church district. Friars in Meycauayan, with established churches, saw a growing need for a dedicated church in Polo. This separation was officially confirmed later in November 1623 as ordered by Spanish Governor-General Alonso Fajardo de Entenza to move forward with the separation of sitio Polo from Catangalan and its establishment as an independent town, though the city currently celebrates its founding day on November 12th. The name of the town, Polo, was a derivation from the Tagalog term pulô, which means "island" or "islet", as it was entirely surrounded by the rivers, thus, creating an impression of itself being an island despite it not being the case. Furthermore, the first Polo Cabeza de Barangay to stand before the newly-minted town was Don Juan Monsod, who worked with Spanish friar Juan Taranco to make the separation from Catangalan possible. Monsod became the first leader, and Taranco managed the church from a small tavern, which is now known as the San Diego de Alcalá church, located in what came to be present-day Barangay Poblacion, the center of the old town of Polo. The ruins of this church that was able to remain until this day—its belfry and entrance arch—serve as a reminder of the long and rich history of the town, and a relic of a bygone era.

                            <p><strong><em>Division and Reunification (July 21, 1960)</em></strong>
                                <br><br>On July 21, 1960, President Carlos P. Garcia signed Executive Order No. 401, dividing Polo into two separate entities: Polo and Valenzuela. What was then the municipality of Polo presented its surrounding territory with the exception of some portions already included in the territory of the municipality of Valenzuela. This new municipality began its operations anew with the appointment and qualification of a mayor, vice-mayor, and councilors to provide for all the statutory obligations and ordinary essential services of a regular municipality. Polo included the northern barangays of Wawang Pulo, Poblacion, Palasan, Arkong Bato, Pariancillo Villa, Balangkas, Mabolo, Coloong, Malanday, Bisig, Tagalag, Rincon, Pasolo, Punturin, Bignay, Viente Reales, and Dalandanan. Meanwhile, Valenzuela consisted of the southern barangays of Karuhatan, Marulas, Malinta, Ugong, Mapulang Lupa, Canumay, Maysan, Parada, Paso de Blas, Bagbaguin, and Torres Bugallón (now known as Gen. T. de Leon). Initially, a provisional town hall was constructed near the location of today's SM City Valenzuela, and later, a permanent town hall was established near the intersection of MacArthur Highway and the old Polo-Novaliches Road.

                            <p><strong><em>Cityhood (1998)</em></strong>
                                <br><br>In 1991, a law gave local governments more control, allowing them to become self-sufficient. In 1998, Valenzuela was made a chartered city by President Ramos, and thereby converted it into a highly urbanized city. The city was also given the corporate powers constituted by its political body corporate, as they are then endowed with the attributes of perpetual succession and possession of capabilities which pertain to a municipal corporation, to be exercised in conformity with the provisions of said charter. The law also divided the city into two legislative districts, with Valenzuela now having its own representation in the House of Representatives. Valenzuela became the 12th city in Metro Manila and the 83rd in the Philippines after the law was approved in December 1998.

                      <p><em><strong>Katipunan and the Philippine Revolution (1896)</strong></em>
                       <br><br>A constituted branch of the Katipunan was established in Polo on February 1, 1896. Dr. Pio Valenzuela, the city's namesake, was a key member of the Katipunan, a revolutionary group against Spanish rule. His entry to the group led to more recruits coming from Polo, including Ulpiano Fernández, Gregorio Flamenco, Crispiniano Agustines, and Faustino Duque. He edited their publication the Ang Kalayaan and participated in crucial discussions leading to the Philippine Revolution. When he stood as the the chief editor, he worked side by side with Fernandez, who held a special role in the Katipunan as a printer of the organization's official newspaper. In a meeting of the secret chamber in July 1896, they decided to assassinate the Spanish Augustinian friar who uncovered the Katipunan to the authorities, but they failed to accomplish the mission.
                       <br><br>Valenzuela also claimed that after the discovery of the Katipunan, he and Bonifacio distributed letters implicating wealthy Filipinos, who refused to extend financial assistance to the Katipunan. He was a member of the committee that was tasked to smuggle arms for the Katipunan from Japan. He was also with Bonifacio, Jacinto and Procopio Bonifacio when they organized the Katipunan council in Cavite. At another secret general meeting called by Bonifacio on the night of May 1, 1896, at Barrio Ugong in Pasig, Valenzuela presented to the body a proposal to solicit contributions to buy arms and munitions from Japan. The proposal was approved on condition that it first be approved by José Rizal, who was in exile in Dapitan in Mindanao. 
                       <br><br>Valenzuela was tasked to discuss the matter with Rizal, and he left for Dapitan on June 15, 1896. However, Rizal told him that the revolution should not be started until sufficient arms had been secured and the support of the wealthy Filipinos had been won over. When the Katipunan was discovered, he fled to Balintawak on August 20, 1896, but he later availed of an amnesty that the Spanish colonial government offered, and he surrendered on September 1, 1896. One of the notable battles in Polo occurred in sitios Bitik and Pasong Balite in Pugad Baboy, where the locals won under the command of General Tiburcio de León y Gregorio. During the course of the revolution, the Spanish forces massacred many of the residents, most of them in Malinta. Suspected revolutionaries were hanged and tortured to death. Many were forced to admit guilt or shout innocent names; others were shot without trial.
