                      <h2>Iconic Structures and Landmarks</h2>
                      <p><strong><em>Residence of Dr Pio Valenzuela</em></strong>
                          <br><br>Pio Valenzuela was a member of the triumvirate of the Katipunan and the namesake of the city. He was born in this house on July 11, 1869. The property can be found along Velilla Street in Barangay Pariancillo Villa. It has become quite the tourist attraction. And deservedly so because of its valuable part in the heritage of the city.
                        </p>
                      <br><br>
                      <p><strong><em>Bell Tower of San Diego de Alcala Church</em></strong>
                          <br><br>The belfry of the San Diego de Alcala Church is more than 400 years old. Like many of the old structures in the country, it’s a cultural and religious relic from the time when Spain occupied the Philippines. This tower, along with the entrance arch, is what remains of the original structure. The main building was destroyed during the Japanese Occupation, but it has since been rebuilt and renovated.
                        </p>
                      <br><br>
                      <p><strong><em>Arkong Bato</em></strong>
                          <br><br>It translates roughly to stone arch. This structure is found along MH del Pilar Street and was built in 1910 by the Americans. Its purpose is to serve as a boundary between the province of Rizal and Bulacan. Today, this arch marks the boundary from Barangay Santolan in Malabon and Barangay Arkong Bato in Valenzuela.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p><strong><em>Museo ng Valenzuela</em></strong>
                            <br><br>It houses a wide range of artifacts and memorabilia that traces the rich history and progress that the city has made. It’s a sprawling museum with an equally impressive architecture with some Spanish aesthetics. Other than housing the culture and history of Valenzuela, cultural and artistic events are also held here, along with public seminars and conventions.
                          </p>
                          <br><br>
                          <p><strong><em>Valenzuela City Convention Center</em></strong>
                              <br><br>This is the city’s center for the performing arts. It’s also a venue for concerts, art shows, exhibits and conventions.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p><strong><em>Valenzuela City Social Hall</em></strong>
                            <br><br>It is a Mediterranean-inspired structure where employees of City Hall work. Meetings and social gatherings are held here as well.
                          </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p><strong><em>National Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima</em></strong>
                            <br><br>It was declared a tourist site by the Department of Tourism in 1982. It was also declared a pilgrimage site by the Diocese of Malolos. This is located near the Our Lady of Fatima University and is the center of the Philippine Fatima apostolate.

                      <h2>Preservation</h2>
                      <p>Once a part of Bulacan, Valenzuela (formerly Polo) boasts a rich history. In recent years, the city has embraced its heritage through ambitious projects. The Museo ni Dr. Pio Valenzuela, opened in 2022, honors a revolutionary hero, while the restored San Diego de Alcala church stands as a testament to the city's colonial past. This blend of the old and new showcases Valenzuela's vibrant past, breathing life into its centuries-old story.
                        <br><br><em>Built from Scratch</em>— Pio Valenzuela's legacy lives on in Valenzuela City. A pre-war bahay na bato, once his clinic and destroyed in WWII, has been meticulously reconstructed using his grandson's memories. Rising from the ashes, the museum embodies the city's commitment to honoring its past.
                        <br><br><em>Arkong Bato</em>— Valenzuela is intricately integrating its past with its future development. An excellent example of this is the preservation of the Arkong Bato, a 19th-century boundary marker, which has been cleverly elevated to accommodate road expansion. It now proudly stands next to the restored Captain Delfin Velilla monument in a new park. Valenzuela's commitment to heritage extends beyond physical structures. Their programs reflect a strong attachment to local history, ensuring that it remains a valued part of the city's identity for generations to come.
                        <br><br><em>Public Art</em>— Beyond heritage restoration, Valenzuela injects vibrant public art into its cityscape. Rescued sculptures like "Suhay-Husay Monument" stand alongside murals by renowned artists. This artistic spirit extends to historical landmarks like the Abueva-crafted Triumvirate Monument. The city isn't just preserving the past, it's creating a living museum for all to experience.
                        <br><br><em>Old Town</em>— Valenzuela has a rich history that spans 400 years, starting as Old Town, formerly known as Polo, established in 1623. The town flourished with a church dedicated to San Diego de Alcala, reflecting Spanish influence. Although the original church complex was affected by war, remnants such as the belfry and convent walls still carry stories from a distant past. This lasting legacy continues to influence the city's lively identity.
